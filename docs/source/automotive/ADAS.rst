What is ADAS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ADAS( Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ) is any of a groups of electronics technologies that assist drivers
in driving and parking funcitons. Through a safe human-machine interface, ADAS increase car and road safety. 
ADAS use automated technology, such as sensors and cameras, to detect nearby obstacles or driver erros, and respond accordingly. ADAS can enable various levels of autonomous driving, depending on the features installed in the car.

History
~~~~~~~

ADAS were first being used in the 1950s with the adoption of the anti-lock braking system. Early ADAS include electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, blind spot information systems, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and traction control. These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments or damage from a collision. This has led many manufacturers to require automatic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed.
