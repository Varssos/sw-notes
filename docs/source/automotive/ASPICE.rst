ASPICE verification and validation model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The verification and Validation model, also known as a V-model, is what Automotive SPICE builds on. The V-model is strict in its requirement for constant evaluation and development, so that potential issues can be eliminated at the first stage. The V-model consists of two stages. Each of them includes different phases, as illustrated in the graphic below.
