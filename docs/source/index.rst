Welcome to SW's notes page
===================================

Content
~~~~~~~

There are notes/tips about C/C++, Bash, Python, Networking, Linux, OpenWrt, Git and Raspbery Pi, ESP.
Everything here is for my private usage.

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

These notes help me to gather core, necessary information about these topics in one place. 
The problem was that I was gaining a lot of information, things I found out in books, stackoverflow, but I wrote it in hedgeDoc, local documents, github.
One day I was trying to find a solution to gather all data with easy access, with divided notes into some topics and I wanted to have easy access on multiple PC.
From my research I found out that Read the Docs will be a good tool for that. In addition knowledge about using `*.rst` files, sphinx and Read the Docs will be beneficial in documentation future projects
