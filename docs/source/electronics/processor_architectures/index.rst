    RISC-V


.. important:: Definitions

   - ISA - Instruction Set Architectures


Architectures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- x86:
   - Closed ISAs
   - Most desktops, laptops & servers
   - Intel and AMD
- ARM:
   - Closed ISA
   - Android, iOS & new Apple computers
- RISC-V:
   - Open ISA
   - Anybody can design and sell a RISC-V processor without any constraints on their actions   

RISC & CISC
