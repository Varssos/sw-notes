RISC-V IP & Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Designers of RISC-V cores and chips can decide whether the intellectual property (IP) they create will be placed in the public domain
- So not all RISC-V technology is open hardware
- The RISC-V ISA can also freely extended
- This gives designers great flexibility when creating custom processors
